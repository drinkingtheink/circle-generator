# Circler - Generative Art Using SVGs

![Circler in Action](https://gdurl.com/Z8uc)

## Generative Art

### The Circler creates random sets of circles (SVGs) or "circlescapes" that are displayed in a variety of different ways to create new visual landscapes.

#### Control from the UI
* Set minimum circle count range
* Set maximum circle count range
* Adjust slideshow scene duration


### [Create some for yourself.](http://circler.surge.sh/)

### Notes About the Generated Circles:
* They are absolutely positioned and can align themselves along almost any top or right aligment
* They have variable z-index settings to provide for stacking visualizations
* They could be of any opacity (so some may be invisible)
* They can have a fill, a stroke, or both
* The stroke is also variable, as is stroke-width and stroke-dasharray
* Animation delays and durations are also variable

## Works Well on Long Screens As Well

### Roadmap

* Generate new circlescapes using arrow keys
* Allow custom color palettes
* Export circlescapes as SVGs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
